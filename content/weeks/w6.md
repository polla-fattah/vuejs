## Overview

**Duration**: October 12-18, 2025
**Focus**: Working with APIs and handling asynchronous operations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Make HTTP requests using fetch and axios
- Handle loading states and error conditions
- Implement proper error handling patterns
- Use async/await with Vue components

## Topics Covered

### 1. HTTP Requests
- Fetch API and modern alternatives
- Axios for HTTP client functionality
- Request/response interceptors
- Error handling and retry logic

### 2. Async Patterns
- Promises and async/await
- Loading state management
- Error boundary patterns
- Concurrent request handling

### 3. Vue Suspense
- Suspense component usage
- Async component loading
- Fallback and error handling
- Performance optimization

### 4. API Integration Best Practices
- Request caching strategies
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Authentication and authorization
- Data transformation and validation

## Lab Activity

### W6 Lab: API Integration with Loading/Error
**Due**: October 18, 2025

#### Requirements
- Create an API service layer
- Implement loading states and error handling
- Build a data fetching component with Suspense
- Handle different API response scenarios

#### Deliverables
- GitHub repository: `webdev-lab-6-[your-username]`
- API integration with proper error handling
- Loading states and user feedback

## Resources

### Required Reading

- [Fetch API Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

## Assessment

This week's lab activity will be graded based on:
- API integration implementation
- Error handling and loading states
- Code organization and best practices
- User experience considerations

## Next Week Preview

Next week we'll explore Vue's reactivity system in depth, covering computed properties and watchers.
