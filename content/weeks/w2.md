## Overview

**Duration**: September 14-20, 2025
**Focus**: Vue component architecture and communication patterns

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Create reusable Vue components with proper TypeScript typing
- Implement parent-child communication using props and emits
- Use slots for flexible component composition
- Apply component design patterns and best practices

## Topics Covered

### 1. Single File Components (SFCs)
- Component structure: `<template>`, `<script>`, `<style>`
- TypeScript integration in SFCs
- Component naming conventions
- File organization strategies

### 2. Props and Emits
- Defining props with TypeScript interfaces
- Prop validation and default values
- Custom events with `defineEmits()`
- Event handling patterns

### 3. Slots and Composition
- Default slots and named slots
- Scoped slots for data passing
- Slot fallbacks and conditional rendering
- Component composition patterns

### 4. Component Communication
- Parent-to-child: Props
- Child-to-parent: Emits
- Sibling components: Event bus or state management
- Component lifecycle hooks

## Lab Activity

### W2 Lab: Reusable Card with Slots
**Due**: September 20, 2025

#### Requirements
- Create a reusable `Card` component with slots
- Implement a `CardHeader`, `CardBody`, and `CardFooter` component
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Demonstrate different slot usage patterns

#### Deliverables

- [Props Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html)
- [Slots Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots.html)

### Code Examples
- Component composition patterns
- TypeScript interfaces for props
- Event handling best practices

## Assessment

This week's lab activity will be graded based on:
- Component reusability and design
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Slot implementation and usage
