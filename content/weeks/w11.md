## Overview

**Duration**: November 16-22, 2025
**Focus**: Performance optimization and deployment strategies

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize bundle size and loading times
- Deploy applications to production environments

## Topics Covered

### 1. Performance Analysis
