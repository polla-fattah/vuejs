## Overview

**Duration**: October 19-25, 2025
**Focus**: Vue's reactivity system and data filtering

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Master computed properties and their optimization
- Use watchers for side effects and data synchronization
- Implement efficient data filtering and searching
- Understand Vue's reactivity system internals

## Topics Covered

### 1. Computed Properties
- Computed vs methods performance
- Computed property caching
- Computed setters and two-way binding
- Computed property composition

### 2. Watchers
- Watch vs watchEffect
- Deep watching and immediate execution
- Watcher cleanup and side effects
- Performance considerations

### 3. Data Filtering
- Array filtering and searching
- Debounced search implementation
- Complex filter combinations
- Performance optimization techniques

### 4. Reactivity System
- Proxy-based reactivity
- Reactive vs ref differences
- UnwrapRef and toRefs utilities
- Custom reactive objects

## Lab Activity

### W7 Lab: Filtered & Categorized Task Board
**Due**: October 25, 2025

#### Requirements
- Create a task board with filtering capabilities
- Implement search and category filtering
- Use computed properties for filtered data
- Add real-time search with debouncing

#### Deliverables
- GitHub repository: `webdev-lab-7-[your-username]`
- Functional task board with filtering
- Optimized computed properties and watchers

## Resources

### Required Reading
